# **Negotiation Chatbot**

## **About the Developer**
This project was created by **Justin Hong**, a student at the **Kyoto University Graduate School of Management**, under the guidance of Professor **Will Baber** for the course *"Workshop."* Professor Baber has provided business negotiation documents, textbooks, and interview transcripts to support the development of this chatbot.


## **Project Introduction**
The **Negotiation Chatbot** is designed to help students learn about business negotiation by using the OpenAI API as a study aid. Unlike regular ChatGPT, which is used for general questions, this chatbot is designed specifically for negotiation-related queries.

The backend uses OpenAI's API to generate answers based on the user's input while referencing Professor Baber’s materials to ensure relevance and accuracy.


## **Programming Languages and Technologies**
This project uses the following technologies:

- **HTML**: To create the user interface, including text, input and output fields, and buttons for an easy-to-use experience.
- **CSS**: To enhance the design, making the interface elegant, responsive, and compatible with both desktop and mobile devices.
- **JavaScript**: To handle API calls to the Python backend and add multilingual support for **English**, **Japanese**, and **Chinese**.
- **Python**: To process user input, access the OpenAI API, and generate negotiation-specific answers. The Python backend also references Professor Baber’s materials to ensure the responses are accurate and contextually relevant.


## **Purpose of the Project**
The **Negotiation Chatbot** aims to:
- Address the limitations of general-purpose chatbots by providing negotiation-specific questions and answers.
- Assist students in understanding business negotiation by offering direct and contextualized answers.
- Enable professors to upload their research and teaching materials, allowing students to quickly access key information and improve learning efficiency.


## **Features**
- **Multilingual Support**: Users can interact with the chatbot in English, Japanese, or Chinese. The chatbot can also answer questions in any desired language.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is compatible with desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Efficient Learning**: Students and professionals can quickly look up negotiation topics, while professors can customize the chatbot with their materials for tailored learning.

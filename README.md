# **About the Developer**

This is a project by Justin Hong from Kyoto University Graduate School of Management. The related course is called "Workshop" and his supervisor is Will Baber. 

# **Project Introduction**

The idea of this project is to use OpenAI API to create a chatbot specifically for Business Negotiation. The backend generates answers based on the question the user provides. Professor Baber has generously provided some of his business negotiation documents, textbooks and interview transcripts to assist with this project. Below are the list of programming languages use to build the chatbot.

 1. HTML - Create the text, input and output fields, and button for an easy to use user interface. 
 2. CSS - To make the interface look elegant and attractive while also adding support for both desktop and mobile devices
 3. JavaScript - to make API calls to the Python backend, and adds support in English, Japanese and Chinese
 4. Python - accesses OpenAI API and generates answers based on the given question in a business negotiation context. It references the documents provided by Professor Baber to ensure every answer is about negotiation

# **Purpose of the Project**

A lot of times, regular ChatGPT gives out too general information, and students want something specific. This project allows students to learn about negotiation which is a complex subject. Professors can also benefit by uploading their research and documents to let students quickly look up topics related to negotiation. This makes learning much more efficient and while assisting people with negotiations.

# **Access**

The project is available in English, Japanese and Chinese. However, the Chatbot can answer any question in any desired language. The user interface is designed to be used on either a desktop, laptop, tablet or mobile phone.

The link to the chatbot is hosted by Heroku and can be found in the following URL - [Negotiation Chatbot Link](https://negotiation-bot-f4a216d5a4ad.herokuapp.com)
